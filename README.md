â€¢	Successfully built a Hangman game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project allowed me to enhance my web development skills and gain hands-on experience in DOM manipulation, event handling, conditional statements, and array usage. The game involves guessing letters of a randomly generated word with a limited number of tries, progressively revealing a hangman illustration for each incorrect guess. This project demonstrates my ability to apply fundamental web development concepts to create engaging and interactive web applications.
